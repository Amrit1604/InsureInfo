    "I am a 45-year-old diabetic patient who has been managing my condition with insulin for 8 years. Last month, while traveling for business in a different state, I suffered a severe hypoglycemic episode that led to unconsciousness and required emergency hospitalization for 3 days including ICU admission. The hospital performed comprehensive tests including cardiac monitoring, neurological assessments, and endocrine consultations. My policy has been active for 18 months. The total bill is ₹2,50,000 including room charges, specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, and medications. The treating physician has recommended follow-up with an endocrinologist and cardiologist due to complications. Will this claim be covered considering my pre-existing diabetes, the out-of-state treatment, the emergency nature, and the comprehensive care required? What percentage of the bill will be covered and are there any specific exclusions I should be aware of?",

    "My 28-year-old wife is 7 months pregnant with our first child. She has the Edelweiss Well Baby Well Mother add-on coverage with base policy UIN EDLHLGP21462V032021, which we purchased 14 months ago specifically for maternity benefits. Two weeks ago, she developed severe pregnancy-induced hypertension (preeclampsia) requiring immediate hospitalization. The doctors performed an emergency C-section at 32 weeks due to fetal distress, and our premature baby was born weighing 1.8 kg. Both mother and baby are now in NICU - my wife for post-surgical complications and blood pressure management, and our baby for respiratory support and feeding assistance. The current hospital bill has already exceeded ₹8,00,000 and is expected to reach ₹15,00,000 with ongoing NICU care for both patients. The neonatologist estimates our baby will need specialized care for 6-8 weeks. Given the emergency nature, premature delivery, and extended NICU stays for both patients, what specific benefits does the Edelweiss Well Baby Well Mother add-on provide? Are there separate coverage limits for mother and baby? Will the extended NICU care be fully covered, and what documentation is required for claim processing?",

    "I am a 52-year-old construction worker who was recently diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by asbestos exposure from my work over the past 25 years. My oncologist has recommended a comprehensive treatment plan including surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, with estimated costs exceeding ₹25,00,000 over the next 18 months. The treatment requires specialized care at a cancer center, including experimental immunotherapy protocols that may not be covered under standard policies. Additionally, I need to travel 800 kilometers to reach the nearest specialized mesothelioma treatment center, requiring temporary relocation for my family. My current health insurance policy has a sum insured of ₹10,00,000 with cancer coverage as a rider. The insurance company is questioning whether this is a pre-existing condition since mesothelioma has a long latency period and symptoms may have been present before policy inception, though undiagnosed. They are also questioning coverage for experimental treatments and travel/accommodation expenses. Given the occupational nature of this disease, the specialized treatment requirements, the inadequate sum insured amount, and the dispute over pre-existing conditions, what are my legal rights? Can I claim compensation from my employer's liability insurance? What specific steps should I take to ensure maximum coverage from my health insurance, and are there government schemes or cancer foundations that can supplement the treatment costs?",

    "My 35-year-old brother, who lives in Germany and works for a multinational corporation, was involved in a serious motorcycle accident while visiting India on vacation. He suffered multiple traumatic injuries including traumatic brain injury, multiple fractures in both legs, internal bleeding, and lung contusion. He was immediately rushed to a private hospital in Goa where he underwent emergency neurosurgery, orthopedic procedures, and was placed on ventilator support in the ICU. After 10 days of critical care, he was deemed stable enough for medical evacuation to Germany for continued treatment and rehabilitation. The Indian hospital bill amounts to ₹12,00,000, and the medical evacuation cost is ₹35,00,000. His German health insurance covers treatment in Germany but excludes emergency treatment abroad and medical evacuation. He has an international travel insurance policy from a German insurer with ₹50,00,000 coverage, but they are denying the claim stating that motorcycle accidents in India are high-risk and excluded under their policy fine print. His employer's group mediclaim policy provides worldwide coverage but has a 30-day waiting period which hadn't completed at the time of the accident. The Indian hospital is demanding immediate payment and threatening to stop treatment. The German embassy is involved but can only provide limited assistance. Given the complex international jurisdiction, multiple insurance policies with different exclusions, the emergency nature requiring immediate payment, and the potential for permanent disability requiring long-term care, what legal options do we have to recover the costs? Can we pursue claims under multiple policies simultaneously? What emergency financial assistance is available for medical treatment abroad, and what documentation is required for international medical insurance claims involving emergency evacuation?"
