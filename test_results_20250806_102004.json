If your payment is outside the grace period, your policy may have lapsed, impacting coverage. If it is within the grace period for installment payments, note that coverage is suspended until the payment is received.",

The insurance company is questioning whether this is a pre-existing condition since mesothelioma has a long latency period and symptoms may have been present before policy inception, though undiagnosed. They are also questioning coverage for experimental treatments and travel/accommodation expenses. Given the occupational nature of this disease, the specialized treatment requirements, the inadequate sum insured amount, and the dispute over pre-existing conditions, what are my legal rights?
